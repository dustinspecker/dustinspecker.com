The next question to answer after writing
[How do Kubernetes and Docker create IP Addresses?!]({{< ref "how-do-kubernetes-and-docker-create-ip-addresses" >}})
is "How does Docker handle publishing ports?"

In the previous post, we created our own network namespaces, virtual interfaces,
and assigned IP addresses to these virtual interfaces. Now we'll learn how to make a request to `127.0.0.1:8080` or
`192.168.0.100:8080` (a local IP address) and forward the request to an HTTP server running in our network namespace. This will help us understand what Docker does
when the `docker run` command is instructed to publish ports.

Docker (version `19.03.6`) uses a couple of techniques including a proxy that binds a port in the host network
namespace and makes requests to a container's network namespace.

This post focuses on the other technique Docker uses, iptables, which can also be used to forward
requests from a port in the host network namespace to an IP address and port residing in another
network namespace.

This post will assume you're familiar with network namespaces and virtual interfaces. If not,
I recommend going back and reading my previous post,
[How do Kubernetes and Docker create IP Addresses?!]({{< ref "how-do-kubernetes-and-docker-create-ip-addresses" >}})

## create network namespaces and virtual devices

First, we'll need to catch up to where
[How do Kubernetes and Docker create IP Addresses?!]({{< ref "how-do-kubernetes-and-docker-create-ip-addresses" >}})
left off.

Let's make sure IP forwarding is enabled by running:

```bash
sudo sysctl --write net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Then execute the following bash commands:

```bash
sudo ip link add dev bridge_home type bridge
sudo ip address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev bridge_home

sudo ip netns add netns_dustin
sudo mkdir -p /etc/netns/netns_dustin
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/netns/netns_dustin/resolv.conf
sudo ip netns exec netns_dustin ip link set dev lo up
sudo ip link add dev veth_dustin type veth peer name veth_ns_dustin
sudo ip link set dev veth_dustin master bridge_home
sudo ip link set dev veth_dustin up
sudo ip link set dev veth_ns_dustin netns netns_dustin
sudo ip netns exec netns_dustin ip link set dev veth_ns_dustin up
sudo ip netns exec netns_dustin ip address add 10.0.0.11/24 dev veth_ns_dustin

sudo ip netns add netns_leah
sudo mkdir -p /etc/netns/netns_leah
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee -a /etc/netns/netns_leah/resolv.conf
sudo ip netns exec netns_leah ip link set dev lo up
sudo ip link add dev veth_leah type veth peer name veth_ns_leah
sudo ip link set dev veth_leah master bridge_home
sudo ip link set dev veth_leah up
sudo ip link set dev veth_ns_leah netns netns_leah
sudo ip netns exec netns_leah ip link set dev veth_ns_leah up
sudo ip netns exec netns_leah ip address add 10.0.0.21/24 dev veth_ns_leah

sudo ip link set bridge_home up
sudo ip netns exec netns_dustin ip route add default via 10.0.0.1
sudo ip netns exec netns_leah ip route add default via 10.0.0.1
```

This will create two network namespaces (`netns_dustin` and `netns_leah`) connected to a virtual
bridge named `bridge_home` via veth pairs. `10.0.0.11` and `10.0.0.21` will be assigned to the
virtual ethernet in the `netns_dustin` and `netns_leah` network namespaces, respectively. Both
network namespaces will be able to communicate with the public internet by using `8.8.8.8` for
DNS.

For a visual aid, our setup now looks like this:

![diagram showing virtual ethernet devices, physical ethernet device, and network namespaces](/images/iptables-how-docker-publishes-ports/network-namespaces-and-virtual-devices.png)

## improve iptables commands from the previous post

In the previous post we ran the following commands (don't run these now!):

```bash
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface bridge_home --out-interface bridge_home --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface bridge_home --out-interface enp4s0 --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface enp4s0 --out-interface bridge_home --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface enp4s0 --jump MASQUERADE
```

These rules enabled traffic to travel across the `bridge_home` virtual bridge and enabled
our network namespaces to communicate with the public internet.

These rules can be simplified and improved by instead running (run these now!):

```bash
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface bridge_home --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --out-interface bridge_home --jump ACCEPT
sudo iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --source 10.0.0.0/24 --jump MASQUERADE
```

Now, what we're saying is any traffic entering or leaving the `bridge_home` interface may be
accepted. And finally, we perform a masquerade on our traffic coming from the `10.0.0.0/24` range,
which covers our veth pairs connected to `bridge_home`.

> Note: we'll cover what `MASQUERADE` means in a little bit.

This has an additional benefit of we don't need to know the name of the physical interface.
Also, this enables other physical interfaces to communicate with our network namespaces.

To validate the setup is working as intended, the following commands need to run successfully:

```bash
ping -c 1 10.0.0.11
ping -c 1 10.0.0.21
sudo ip netns exec netns_dustin ping -c 1 10.0.0.21
sudo ip netns exec netns_leah ping -c 1 10.0.0.11
```

This will validate the host is able to communicate the network namespaces and that the two network
namespaces may communicate with each other as well.

## iptables tips

Throughout this post we're going to be modifying iptables. A helpful command to view all
iptables rules is:

```bash
sudo iptables-save
```

This will print the iptables as-is. Great for seeing what's going on! I recommend running `sudo iptables-save`
whenever we're modifying iptables.

> Note: `iptables-save` will show short argument names instead of long ones, so `-A` instead of `--append`.

In fact, this is a great way to make a back up of iptables. If we were to do:

```bash
sudo iptables-save > iptables.bak
```

we'd create a file named `iptables.bak` that we could restore our iptables from. To restore, run:

```bash
sudo iptables-restore iptables.bak
```

We can also restart the computer to get our old iptables back.

## use iptables to perform a port forward

Now, on to the fun stuff. Let's spin up a Python HTTP server in the `netns_dustin` network
namespace by running:

```bash
sudo ip netns exec netns_dustin python3 -m http.server 8080
```

This will start an HTTP server running on port 8080.

Open another terminal and find your local IP address (`ip address list`). I'll
use `192.168.0.100` as the local IP address in this post, but please remember to
replace it with your own.

If we then attempt to run:

```bash
curl 192.168.0.100:8080
```

we'll get an expected error stating:

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.0.100 port 8080: Connection refused
```

We need to instruct iptables that when a request is made to port `8080` to direct that traffic to
`10.0.0.11:8080` instead. We can do that by running:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append OUTPUT \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

This adds a rule to the `nat` table. The `nat` table is used for Network Address Translation. In
this case, we're configuring a `DNAT` rule, which stands for Destination Network Address Translation.
This rule will match any packet using TCP destined for port 8080. At that point, it'll set the
destination IP and port on the packet to `10.0.0.11:8080`.

> Note: Why `--match tcp` and `--protocol tcp`? `--protocol tcp` specifies the rule is for TCP,
> while `--match tcp` loads more specification options related to TCP like `--dport`, which
> we use in the above rule.

> Note: There's also a `SNAT` (Source Network Address Translation), which is similar to `DNAT` but

Enough with the notes, now we can run:

```bash
curl 192.168.0.100:8080
```

Perfect! But now for some bad news. Try running:

```bash
curl 192.168.0.101:8080
```

and try running:

```bash
curl www.google.com:8080
```

Both of these will "work" and get a response from our own HTTP server! This is undesirable, to say the
least. Fortunately, iptables supports many options for rules. In the iptables rule above,
we specified it needs to match on `--dport` (destination port) and TCP protocol. We can also
specify a match on the destination IP.

First delete the previously created iptables rule via:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --delete OUTPUT \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

and add a more specific rule:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append OUTPUT \
  --destination 192.168.0.100/32 \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

Now making a request to `192.168.0.101:8080` and `www.google.com:8080` both fail, while a request
to `192.1.0.100:8080` still works.

We can improve this rule even more. Unless `192.168.0.100` is a static IP, there's a chance
our local IP address could change in the future. That would mean we'd have to constantly
update our iptables rule. Bleh!

iptables has another helpful feature we can use.

Once again, delete the previously created rule:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --delete OUTPUT \
  --destination 192.168.0.100/32 \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

and add an improved rule via:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append OUTPUT \
  --match addrtype \
  --dst-type LOCAL \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

Instead of specifying a destination IP address we instead use `--match addrtype --dst-type LOCAL`
to match any local destination. If you'd like, you may verify the request still works via:

```bash
curl 192.168.100:8080
```

## enable external traffic to be port forwarded

On a second device such as a phone or another computer on the same network, navigate to
`192.168.0.100:8080` in a browser. This will fail.

The rule we created was for the `OUTPUT` chain in the `nat` table. The `OUTPUT` chain is used
for locally created packets. The `nat` table has another chain for packets entering the system
from an external source. This chain is named `PREROUTING`. [Brent Salisbury](https://twitter.com/networkstatic) has created a helpful GitHub Gist,
[Linux NetFilter, IP Tables and Conntrack Diagrams](https://gist.github.com/nerdalert/a1687ae4da1cc44a437d),
as an overview of these different tables and chains.

To correctly route external traffic, we can define the exact same rule as above, but append
it to the `PREROUTING` chain instead of the `OUTPUT` chain. Do so by running:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append PREROUTING \
  --match addrtype \
  --dst-type LOCAL \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

Now on the second device, reload `192.168.0.100:8080` and we'll get a response from our HTTP
server!

## create a custom iptables chain

We now have two identical rules on separate chains (`PREROUTING` and `OUTPUT`) in the `nat`
table. We can create a custom chain to [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
these rules.

To create a new chain in the `nat` table named `DUSTIN`, run:

```bash
sudo iptables --table nat --new DUSTIN
```

We'll then add our duplicated rule from above to the `DUSTIN` chain like so:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append DUSTIN \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

We'll add another rule in the `DUSTIN` chain that will tell iptables to return to the rest of
the chain calling this chain if none of the other rules in `DUSTIN` are a match.

```
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append DUSTIN \
  --jump RETURN
```

> Note: Technically our `RETURN` rule is not needed. If iptables reaches the end of a custom
> chain then iptables will proceed with the following rules after the jump to the custom chain.
> Netfilter describes this in its
> [Target Specifications](http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO/packet-filtering-HOWTO-7.html#ss7.4) documentation.

Let's delete the old duplicated rules in the `PREROUTING` and `OUTPUT` chains by running:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --delete PREROUTING \
  --match addrtype \
  --dst-type LOCAL \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080

sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --delete OUTPUT \
  --match addrtype \
  --dst-type LOCAL \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8080 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.11:8080
```

Then we can add two rules to instruct the `PREROUTING` and `OUTPUT` chains to use the `DUSTIN`
chain whenever a `LOCAL` address type is used for the destination.

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append PREROUTING \
  --match addrtype \
  --dst-type LOCAL \
  --jump DUSTIN

sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append OUTPUT \
  --match addrtype \
  --dst-type LOCAL \
  --jump DUSTIN
```

We could have associated the `--match addrtype --dst-type LOCAL` on the rule in the `DUSTIN`
chain and omitted it from these two rules. However, in a little bit, we'll add another rule to
the `DUSTIN` chain and since the `--match addrtype --dst-type LOCAL` is at the calling chain
(`PREROUTING` or `OUTPUT`), we don't have to remember to always add this to every rule in the
`DUSTIN` chain. This is what Docker does as well, so we'll match them.

# add another port forward in the custom chain

Let's start another HTTP server in the `netns_leah` network namespace:

```bash
sudo ip netns exec netns_leah python3 -m http.server 8081
```

We'll need to add another rule to the `DUSTIN` chain by running:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --append DUSTIN \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8081 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.21:8081
```

If we then make a request to port `8081` by running:

```bash
curl 192.168.0.100:8081
```

It'll fail. Wait, fail?!

So rules in iptables are performed in order. If we look at the existing rules in the `DUSTIN` chain
via:

```bash
sudo iptables --table nat --list DUSTIN
```

We'll see the following output:

```
Chain DUSTIN (2 references)
target     prot opt source               destination
DNAT       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http-alt to:10.0.0.11:8080
RETURN     all  --  anywhere             anywhere
DNAT       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:tproxy to:10.0.0.21:8081
```

So append is, well, appending to the end of the chain. We need to make sure the new rule is before
the jump to `RETURN`. We can use `--insert` instead of `--append` to specify where to place the rule.

First, delete the rule we just made:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --delete DUSTIN \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8081 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.21:8081
```

and then insert the rule after our other port forwarding rule, but before the `RETURN` rule:

```bash
sudo iptables \
  --table nat \
  --insert DUSTIN 2 \
  --protocol tcp \
  --match tcp \
  --dport 8081 \
  --jump DNAT \
  --to-destination 10.0.0.21:8081
```

Now the following request will work:

```bash
curl 192.168.0.100:8081
```

# docker-proxy and local network

So far we've been using the `192.168.0.100` IP address, but what happens if we try `127.0.0.1`,
`0.0.0.0`, or `localhost`? The following will all fail:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080
curl 0.0.0.0:8080
curl localhost:8080
```

By default, Linux will not consider our iptables rules for the local network. As mentioned in the intro,
Docker gets around this by running another process, `docker-proxy`, when running a container exposing ports.

This proxy has a few benefits:

- works for forwarding ports on the local network as this will not use iptables
- works when Docker is configured to not modify iptables
- binds the port on the host network to verify no other process is or could use the same port

We can do something similar using `socat`. On Ubuntu, `socat` may be installed via:

```bash
sudo apt install socat --yes
```

Once `socat` is installed we can then run:

```bash
socat tcp-l:8080,fork,reuseaddr tcp:10.0.0.11:8080
```

This instructs `socat` to listen on port 8080 and forward requests to `10.0.0.11:8080`.

Next, we'll need to make sure a `MASQUERADE` is being performed on requests coming from the local network
into our `bridge_home` device. This can be configured by running:

```bash
sudo iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --source 127.0.0.1 --out-interface bridge_home -j MASQUERADE
```

At this point the following requests will work:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080
curl 0.0.0.0:8080
curl localhost:8080
```

# forward ports on the local network using iptables

I'm stubborn and don't like admitting defeat to computers, so I want to understand how to use
iptables to forward a port on the local network. Be sure to terminate the `socat` process (`CTRL+c`
should do the trick).

We'll need to enable the `route_localnet` option so that we can instruct Linux to properly direct
our port forwarding on the local network via iptables. Run:

```bash
sudo sysctl --write net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1
```

After enabling routing on the local network and adding the `MASQUERADE` rule in the previous
section, the following requests will work:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8080
curl 0.0.0.0:8080
curl localhost:8080
```

and without a proxy!

# some future research topics

Learning all of this stuff typically ends with me having more questions such as:

- Why does Docker not enable local network routing?
  - Update (August 1st, 2020): [Tabitha Sable](https://twitter.com/TabbySable) wrote about a [Kubernetes CVE](https://github.com/tabbysable/POC-2020-8558) where
    enabling routing on the local network is the culprit. So yeah, bad idea.
- How to better debug iptables? I'm familiar with using `TRACE` and `LOG`, but please let me know
  if you have tools you like to use instead!
- Not a question, but I want to learn more about `conntrack`. Docker uses this. `conntrack` seems
  to "remember" the iptables rule result for a given source, so that not every packet
  from the same source has to traverse all of the iptables rules.

Did I explain something poorly or, worse, wrong? Know the answer to one of the above questions?
Then please feel free to reach out and let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dustinspecker),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-specker/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/dustinspecker).
