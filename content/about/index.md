I've been writing software professionally since 2013. My career began with a focus on
JavaScript technologies such as AngularJS, Ember.js, and Node.js. Recently I've transitioned
to focusing more on Kubernetes and Golang.

In September 2020 and October 2020, I passed the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
and Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exams. Currently, I'm studying for the Certified
Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKSS) exam.

This blog attempts to organize what I learn and have a knowledge base that I can refer
back to in the future.
