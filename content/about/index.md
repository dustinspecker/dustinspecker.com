I've been writing software professionally since 2013. Most of my career has been focused on
JavaScript technologies such as AngularJS, Ember.js, and Node.js. Recently I've transitioned
to focusing more on Kubernetes and Golang.

This is an attempt to organize what I learn and to have a knowledge base that I can refer
back to in the future.
